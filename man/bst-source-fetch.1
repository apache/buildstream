.SH NAME
bst\-source\-fetch \- Fetch sources in a pipeline
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bst source fetch
[OPTIONS] [ELEMENTS]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Fetch sources required to build the pipeline
.PP
Specifying no elements will result in fetching the default targets
of the project. If no default targets are configured, all project
elements will be fetched.
.PP
When this command is executed from a workspace directory, the default
is to fetch the workspace element.
.PP
By default this will only try to fetch sources which are
required for the build plan of the specified target element,
omitting sources for any elements which are already built
and available in the artifact cache.
.PP
Specify `--deps` to control which sources to fetch:
.PP

    none:  No dependencies, just the element itself
    plan:  Only dependencies required for the build plan
    run:   Runtime dependencies, including the element itself
    build: Build time dependencies, excluding the element itself
    all:   All dependencies
