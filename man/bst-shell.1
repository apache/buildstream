.SH NAME
bst\-shell \- Shell into an element's sandbox environment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bst shell
[OPTIONS] [ELEMENT] [COMMAND]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Run a command in the target element's sandbox environment
.PP
When this command is executed from a workspace directory, the default
is to shell into the workspace element.
.PP
This will stage a temporary sysroot for running the target
element, assuming it has already been built and all required
artifacts are in the local cache.
.PP
Use '--' to separate a command from the options to bst,
otherwise bst may respond to them instead. e.g.
.PP

    bst shell example.bst -- df -h
.PP
Use the --build option to create a temporary sysroot for
building the element instead.
.PP
If no COMMAND is specified, the default is to attempt
to run an interactive shell.
