.SH NAME
bst\-artifact\-log \- Show logs of artifacts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bst artifact log
[OPTIONS] [ARTIFACTS]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Show logs of artifacts.
.PP
Note that 'artifacts' can be element references like "hello.bst", and they
can also be artifact references. You may use shell-style wildcards for
either.
.PP
Here are some examples of element references:
.PP

- `hello.bst`
- `*.bst`
.PP
Note that element references must end with '.bst' to distinguish them from
artifact references. Anything that does not end in '.bst' is an artifact
ref.
.PP
Artifact references follow the format `<project_name>/<element>/<key>`.
Note that 'element' is without the `.bst` extension.
.PP
Here are some examples of artifact references:
.PP

