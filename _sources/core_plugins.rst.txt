Plugin specific documentation
=============================
Plugins provide their own individual plugin specific YAML configurations,
The element ``.bst`` files can specify plugin specific configuration in
the :ref:`config section <format_config>`, while sources declared on a
given element specify their plugin specific configuration directly
:ref:`in their source declarations <format_sources>`.


.. _plugins_elements:

Elements
--------
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   elements/stack
   elements/import
   elements/compose
   elements/script
   elements/link
   elements/junction
   elements/filter
   elements/manual


.. _plugins_sources:

Sources
-------

All source plugins can be staged into an arbitrary directory within the build
sandbox with the ``directory`` option.
See :ref:`Source class built-in functionality <core_source_builtins>` for more
information.

.. toctree::

   sources/local
   sources/remote
   sources/tar


.. _plugins_external:

External plugins
----------------
External plugins need to be :ref:`loading through junctions <project_plugins_junction>`,
or alternatively installed separately in the python environment where you are
running BuildStream and loaded using the :ref:`pip method <project_plugins_pip>`.

Here is a list of BuildStream plugin projects known to us at this time:

* `buildstream-plugins <https://github.com/apache/buildstream-plugins/>`_
* `buildstream-plugins-community (formerly known as bst-plugins-experimental) <http://buildstream.gitlab.io/buildstream-plugins-community/>`_
* `bst-plugins-container <https://pypi.org/project/bst-plugins-container/>`_
