What is BuildStream?
====================

BuildStream is a Free Software tool for building/integrating software stacks.
It takes inspiration, lessons and use-cases from various projects including
OBS, Reproducible Builds, Yocto, Baserock, Buildroot, Aboriginal, GNOME Continuous,
JHBuild, Flatpak Builder and Android repo.

BuildStream supports multiple build-systems (e.g. autotools, cmake, cpan, distutils,
make, meson, qmake), covers many programming languages, and can create outputs in a
range of packaging formats, for multiple platforms and chipsets.

Why should I use BuildStream?
=============================

BuildStream offers the following advantages:

* **Declarative build instructions/definitions**

  BuildStream provides a a flexible and extensible framework for the modelling
  of software build pipelines in a declarative YAML format, which allows you to
  manipulate filesystem data in a controlled, reproducible sandboxed environment.

* **Support for developer and integrator workflows**

  BuildStream provides traceability and reproducibility for integrators handling
  stacks of hundreds/thousands of components, as well as workspace features and
  shortcuts to minimise cycle-time for developers.

* **Fast and predictable**

  BuildStream can cache previous builds and track changes to source file content
  and build/config commands. BuildStream only rebuilds the things that have changed.

* **Extensible**

  You can extend BuildStream to support your favourite build-system.

* **Bootstrap toolchains and bootable systems**

  BuildStream can create full systems and complete toolchains from scratch, for
  a range of ISAs including x86_32, x86_64, ARMv7, ARMv8, MIPS.

How do I use BuildStream?
=========================

Please refer to the `documentation <https://buildstream.gitlab.io/buildstream/>`_
for  information about installing BuildStream, and about the BuildStream YAML format
and plugin options.

How does BuildStream work?
==========================

BuildStream operates on a set of YAML files (.bst files), as follows:

* loads the YAML files which describe the target(s) and all dependencies
* evaluates the version information and build instructions to calculate a build
  graph for the target(s) and all dependencies and unique cache-keys for each
  element
* retrieves elements from cache if they are already built, or builds them in a
  sandboxed environment using the instructions declared in the .bst files
* transforms/configures and/or deploys the resulting target(s) based on the
  instructions declared in the .bst files.

How can I get started?
======================

The easiest way to get started is to explore some existing .bst files, for example:

* https://gitlab.com/baserock/definitions
