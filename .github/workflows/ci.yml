# Run the CI if branches are pushed locally, allowing us to
# run CI without the need of creating a pull request.

# Run the CI on pull requests only if they are from forked
# repositories.

on:
  push:
    branches-ignore:
    - gh-pages
    - master
  pull_request:
    types: [assigned, opened, synchronize, reopened]
    branches:
      # Branches from forks have the form 'user:branch-name' so we only run
      # this job on pull_request events for branches that look like fork
      # branches. Without this we would end up running this job twice for non
      # forked PRs, once for the push and then once for opening the PR.

# Left to-do:
# - coverage
# - publishing docs to gh-pages
# - persistent artifact cache
# - overnight jobs
# - other one-off jobs like missing-deps, plugin jobs etc
# - wsl tasks (TODO: Check if GitHub's Windows runners allow WSL)
#
# New opportunities:
# - run tests on mac (GitHub provides MacOS runners)
# - standardize WSL tasks by using GitHub-provided runners
