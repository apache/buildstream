      # forked PRs, once for the push and then once for opening the PR.

# Left to-do:
# - coverage
# - publishing docs to gh-pages
# - persistent artifact cache
# - overnight jobs
# - wsl tasks (TODO: Check if GitHub's Windows runners allow WSL)
#
# New opportunities:
# - run tests on mac (GitHub provides MacOS runners)
# - standardize WSL tasks by using GitHub-provided runners
