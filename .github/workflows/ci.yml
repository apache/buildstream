# We don't run these jobs on pull requests because:
# 1. it is often useful to run tests on one's branch without creating a pull
#    request, and
# 2. running on both pushes and pull requests results in the classic problem of
#    having double jobs.
on: push

# Left to-do:
# - coverage
# - publishing docs to gh-pages
# - persistent artifact cache
# - overnight jobs
# - other one-off jobs like missing-deps, plugin jobs etc
# - wsl tasks (TODO: Check if GitHub's Windows runners allow WSL)
#
# New opportunities:
# - run tests on mac (GitHub provides MacOS runners)
# - standardize WSL tasks by using GitHub-provided runners
