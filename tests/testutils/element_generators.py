# create_element_size()
#
# Creates an import element with a git repo, using random
# data to create a file in that repo of the specified size,
# such that building it will add an artifact of the specified
# size to the artifact cache.
#
# Args:
#    name: (str) of the element name (e.g. target.bst)
#    project_dir (str): The path to the project
#    element_path (str): The element path within the project
#    dependencies: A list of strings (can also be an empty list)
#    size: (int) size of the element in bytes
#
# Returns:
#    (Repo): A repo representing the sized element
#
