cmake - CMake build element
===========================
This is a :mod:`BuildElement <buildstream.buildelement>` implementation for
using the `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`_ build system.

You will often want to pass additional arguments to the ``cmake`` program for
specific configuration options. This should be done on a per-element basis by
setting the ``cmake-local`` variable.  Here is an example:

.. code:: yaml

   variables:
     cmake-local: |
       -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

If you want to pass extra options to ``cmake`` for every element in your
project, set the ``cmake-global`` variable in your project.conf file. Here is
an example of that:

.. code:: yaml

   elements:
     cmake:
       variables:
         cmake-global: |
           -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

Here is the default configuration for the ``cmake`` element in full:

  .. literalinclude:: ../../../src/buildstream/plugins/elements/cmake.yaml
     :language: yaml

See :ref:`built-in functionality documentation <core_buildelement_builtins>` for
details on common configuration options for build elements.
