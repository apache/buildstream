<h1>Contributing<a class="headerlink" href="#contributing" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Some tips and guidelines for developers hacking on BuildStream</p>
<section id="filing-issues">
<span id="contributing-filing-issues"></span><h2>Filing issues<a class="headerlink" href="#filing-issues" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>If you are experiencing an issue with BuildStream, or would like to submit a patch
to fix an issue, then you should first search the list of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/apache/buildstream/issues">open issues</a>
to see if the issue is already filed, and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/apache/buildstream/issues/new">open an issue</a>
if no issue already exists.</p>
</section>
<section id="fixing-bugs">
<span id="contributing-fixing-bugs"></span><h2>Fixing bugs<a class="headerlink" href="#fixing-bugs" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Before fixing a bug, it is preferred that an <a class="reference internal" href="#contributing-filing-issues"><span class="std std-ref">issue be filed</span></a>
first in order to better document the defect, however this need not be followed to the
letter for minor fixes.</p>
<p>Patches which fix bugs should always come with a regression test.</p>
</section>
<section id="adding-new-features">
<span id="contributing-adding-features"></span><h2>Adding new features<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-new-features" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Feature additions should be proposed on the <a class="reference external" href="https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev&#64;buildstream.apache.org">mailing list</a>
before being considered for inclusion. To save time and avoid any frustration,
we strongly recommend proposing your new feature in advance of commencing work.</p>
<p>Once consensus has been reached on the mailing list, then the proposing
party should <a class="reference internal" href="#contributing-filing-issues"><span class="std std-ref">file an issue</span></a> to track the
work.</p>
<p>New features must be well documented and tested in our test suite.</p>
<p>It is expected that the individual submitting the work take ownership
of their feature within BuildStream for a reasonable timeframe of at least
one release cycle after their work has landed on the master branch. This is
to say that the submitter is expected to address and fix any side effects,
bugs or regressions which may have fell through the cracks in the review
process, giving us a reasonable timeframe for identifying these.</p>
</section>
<section id="submitting-patches">
<span id="contributing-submitting-patches"></span><h2>Submitting patches<a class="headerlink" href="#submitting-patches" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Submitting patches works in the regular GitHub workflow of submitting
pull requests.</p>
<section id="branch-names">
<h3>Branch names<a class="headerlink" href="#branch-names" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>If you are an apache member with access to the main repository, and are
submitting a pull request for a branch within the main repository, then
please be careful to use an identifiable branch name.</p>
<p>Branch names for pull requests should be prefixed with the submitter’s
name or nickname, followed by a forward slash, and then a descriptive
name. e.g.:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">username</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">fix</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">that</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">bug</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This allows us to more easily identify which branch does what and
belongs to whom, especially so that we can effectively cleanup stale
branches in the upstream repository over time.</p>
</section>
<section id="pull-requests">
<h3>Pull requests<a class="headerlink" href="#pull-requests" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Once you have created a local branch, you can push it to the upstream
BuildStream repository using the command line:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">push</span> <span class="n">origin</span> <span class="n">username</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">fix</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">that</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">bug</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>GitHub will respond to this with a message and a link to allow you to create
a new merge request. You can also <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/apache/buildstream/compare">create a pull request using the GitHub UI</a>.</p>
<p>You may open pull requests for the branches you create before you are ready
to have them reviewed and considered for inclusion if you like. Until your merge
request is ready for review, the pull request title must be prefixed with the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WIP:</span></code> identifier.</p>
<p>Consider marking a pull request as WIP again if you are taking a while to
address a review point. This signals that the next action is on you, and it
won’t appear in a reviewer’s search for non-WIP merge requests to review.</p>
</section>
<section id="organized-commits">
<h3>Organized commits<a class="headerlink" href="#organized-commits" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Submitted branches must not contain a history of the work done in the
feature branch. For example, if you had to change your approach, or
have a later commit which fixes something in a previous commit on your
branch, we do not want to include the history of how you came up with
your patch in the upstream master branch.</p>
<p>Please use git’s interactive rebase feature in order to compose a clean
patch series suitable for submission upstream.</p>
<p>Every commit in series should pass the test suite, this is very important
for tracking down regressions and performing git bisections in the future.</p>
<p>We prefer that documentation changes be submitted in separate commits from
the code changes which they document, and newly added test cases are also
preferred in separate commits.</p>
<p>If a commit in your branch modifies behavior such that a test must also
be changed to match the new behavior, then the tests should be updated
with the same commit, so that every commit passes its own tests.</p>
<p>These principles apply whenever a branch is non-WIP. So for example, don’t push
‘fixup!’ commits when addressing review comments, instead amend the commits
directly before pushing.</p>
</section>
<section id="commit-messages">
<h3>Commit messages<a class="headerlink" href="#commit-messages" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Commit messages must be formatted with a brief summary line, followed by
an empty line and then a free form detailed description of the change.</p>
<p>The summary line must start with what changed, followed by a colon and
a very brief description of the change.</p>
<p>If the commit fixes an issue, or is related to an issue; then the issue
number must be referenced in the commit message.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">element</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">py</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Added</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">frobnicator</span> <span class="n">so</span> <span class="n">that</span> <span class="n">foos</span> <span class="n">are</span> <span class="n">properly</span> <span class="n">frobbed</span><span class="o">.</span>

<span class="n">The</span> <span class="n">new</span> <span class="n">frobnicator</span> <span class="n">frobnicates</span> <span class="n">foos</span> <span class="nb">all</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">way</span> <span class="n">throughout</span>
<span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">element</span><span class="o">.</span> <span class="n">Elements</span> <span class="n">that</span> <span class="n">are</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">properly</span> <span class="n">frobnicated</span> <span class="k">raise</span>
<span class="n">an</span> <span class="n">error</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">inform</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">user</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">invalid</span> <span class="n">frobnication</span> <span class="n">rules</span><span class="o">.</span>

<span class="n">Fixes</span> <span class="c1">#123</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that the ‘why’ of a change is as important as the ‘what’.</p>
<p>When reviewing this, folks can suggest better alternatives when they know the
‘why’. Perhaps there are other ways to avoid an error when things are not
frobnicated.</p>
<p>When folks modify this code, there may be uncertainty around whether the foos
should always be frobnicated. The comments, the commit message, and issue #123
should shed some light on that.</p>
<p>In the case that you have a commit which necessarily modifies multiple
components, then the summary line should still mention generally what
changed (if possible), followed by a colon and a brief summary.</p>
<p>In this case the free form detailed description of the change should
contain a bullet list describing what was changed in each component
separately.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<section id="committer-access">
<h2>Committer access<a class="headerlink" href="#committer-access" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Committers in the BuildStream project are those folks to whom the right to
directly commit changes to our version controlled resources has been granted.</p>
<p>While every contribution is valued regardless of its source, not every person
who contributes code to the project will earn commit access.
The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/apache/buildstream/blob/master/COMMITTERS.rst">COMMITTERS</a> file lists all committers.</p>
<section id="how-commit-access-is-granted">
<h3>How commit access is granted<a class="headerlink" href="#how-commit-access-is-granted" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>After someone has successfully contributed a few non-trivial patches, some full
committer, usually whoever has reviewed and applied the most patches from that
contributor, proposes them for commit access. This proposal is sent only to the
other full committers - the ensuing discussion is private, so that everyone can
feel comfortable speaking their minds. Assuming there are no objections, the
contributor is granted commit access. The decision is made by consensus; there
are no formal rules governing the procedure, though generally if someone strongly
objects the access is not offered, or is offered on a provisional basis.</p>
<p>This of course relies on contributors being responsive and showing willingness
to address any problems that may arise after landing patches. However, the primary
criterion for commit access is good judgement.</p>
<p>You do not have to be a technical wizard or demonstrate deep knowledge of the
entire codebase to become a committer. You just need to know what you don’t
know. Non-code contributions are just as valuable in the path to commit access.
If your patches adhere to the guidelines in this file, adhere to all the usual
unquantifiable rules of coding (code should be readable, robust, maintainable, etc.),
and respect the Hippocratic Principle of “first, do no harm”, then you will probably
get commit access pretty quickly. The size, complexity, and quantity of your patches
do not matter as much as the degree of care you show in avoiding bugs and minimizing
unnecessary impact on the rest of the code. Many full committers are people who have
not made major code contributions, but rather lots of small, clean fixes, each of
which was an unambiguous improvement to the code. (Of course, this does not mean the
project needs a bunch of very trivial patches whose only purpose is to gain commit
access; knowing what’s worth a patch post and what’s not is part of showing good
judgement.)</p>

<section id="windows-ci">
<h2>Windows CI<a class="headerlink" href="#windows-ci" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The infrastructure for running the CI against Windows is different from the usual
runners, due to a combination of licensing technicalities and differing
containerisation support.</p>
<p>The scripts used to generate a CI runner can be found at
<cite>https://gitlab.com/BuildStream/windows-startup-script</cite>.
The <cite>wsl</cite> branch can be used to generate a runner for WSL, and the <cite>win32</cite> branch
can be used to generate a native-windows runner.</p>
