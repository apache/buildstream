Releases
========
BuildStream follows the Semantic Versioning Convention `(SemVer) <https://semver.org/>`_
for releases and development snapshops.

For example, for a given version number ``X.Y.Z``
 * The ``X.<even number>.*`` versions are stable releases
 * The ``X.<odd number>.*`` versions are development spanshots.

Therefore, please look for the latest tag in the latest release branch to ensure
you're getting the latest release

Current release branches:
 * `bst-1.2 (latest) <https://gitlab.com/BuildStream/buildstream/commits/bst-1.2>`_
     * Latest release: `1.1.6 <https://gitlab.com/BuildStream/buildstream/tags/1.1.6>`_
 * `bst-1.0 (deprecated) <https://gitlab.com/BuildStream/buildstream/commits/bst-1.0>`_

Check the :ref:`BuildStream installation instructions <main_install>` for the different options to install them
