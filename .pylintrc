# We have three groups of disabled messages:
#
# 1) Messages that are of no use to us
#    This is either because we don't follow the convention
#    (missing-docstring and protected-access come to mind), or because
#    it's not very useful in CI (too-many-arguments, for example)
#
# 2) Messages that we would like to enable at some point
#    We introduced linting quite late into the project, so there are
#    some issues that just grew out of control. Resolving these would
#    be nice, but too much work atm.
#
# 3) Messages related to code formatting
#    Since we use Black to format code automatically, there's no need for
#    pylint to also check for those things.
