Plugin - Base plugin class
==========================
BuildStream supports third party plugins to define additional kinds of
:mod:`Elements <buildstream.element>` and :mod:`Sources <buildstream.source>`.

The common API is documented here, along with some information on how
external plugin packages are structured.


.. _core_plugin_abstract_methods:

Abstract Methods
----------------
For both :mod:`Elements <buildstream.element>` and :mod:`Sources <buildstream.source>`,
it is mandatory to implement the following abstract methods:

* :func:`Plugin.configure() <buildstream.plugin.Plugin.configure>`

  Loads the user provided configuration YAML for the given source or element

* :func:`Plugin.preflight() <buildstream.plugin.Plugin.preflight>`

  Early preflight checks allow plugins to bail out early with an error
  in the case that it can predict that failure is inevitable.

* :func:`Plugin.get_unique_key() <buildstream.plugin.Plugin.get_unique_key>`

  Once all configuration has been loaded and preflight checks have passed,
  this method is used to inform the core of a plugin's unique configuration.

Configurable Warnings
---------------------
Warnings raised through calling :func:`Plugin.warn() <buildstream.plugin.Plugin.warn>` can provide an optional
parameter ``warning_token``, this will raise a :class:`PluginError` if the warning is configured as fatal within
the project configuration.

Configurable warnings will be prefixed with :func:`Plugin.get_kind() <buildstream.plugin.Plugin.get_kind>`
within buildstream and must be prefixed as such in project configurations. For more detail on project configuration
see :ref:`Configurable Warnings <configurable_warnings>`.

It is important to document these warnings in your plugin documentation to allow users to make full use of them
while configuring their projects.

Example
~~~~~~~
If the :class:`git <buildstream.plugins.sources.git.GitSource>` plugin uses the warning ``"inconsistent-submodule"``
then it could be referenced in project configuration as ``"git:inconsistent-submodule"``.

Plugin Structure
----------------
A plugin should consist of a `setuptools package
<http://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html>`_ that
advertises contained plugins using `entry points
<http://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#dynamic-discovery-of-services-and-plugins>`_.

A plugin entry point must be a module that extends a class in the
:ref:`core_framework` to be discovered by BuildStream. A YAML file
defining plugin default settings with the same name as the module can
also be defined in the same directory as the plugin module.

.. note::

    BuildStream does not support function/class entry points.

A sample plugin could be structured as such:

.. code-block:: text

    .
    ├── elements
    │   ├── autotools.py
    │   ├── autotools.yaml
    │   └── __init__.py
    ├── MANIFEST.in
    └── setup.py

The setuptools configuration should then contain at least:

setup.py:

.. literalinclude:: ../source/sample_plugin/setup.py
   :language: python

MANIFEST.in:

.. literalinclude:: ../source/sample_plugin/MANIFEST.in
   :language: text
