# Job()
#
# The Job object represents a task that will run in parallel to the main
# process. It has some methods that are not implemented - they are meant for
# you to implement in a subclass.
#
# It has a close relationship with the ChildJob class, and it can be considered
# a two part solution:
#
# 1. A Job instance, which will create a ChildJob instance and arrange for
#    childjob.child_process() to be executed in another process.
# 2. The created ChildJob instance, which does the actual work.
#
# This split makes it clear what data is passed to the other process and what
# is executed in which process.
#
# To set up a minimal new kind of Job, e.g. YourJob:
#
# 1. Create a YourJob class, inheriting from Job.
# 2. Create a YourChildJob class, inheriting from ChildJob.
# 3. Implement YourJob.create_child_job() and YourJob.parent_complete().
# 4. Implement YourChildJob.child_process().
#
# A Job instance and its ChildJob share a message queue. You may send custom
# messages to the main process using YourChildJob.send_message(). Such messages
# must be processed in YourJob.handle_message(), which you will also need to
# override for this purpose.

# how to set up a (Job, ChildJob pair).

#
# Args:
#    scheduler (Scheduler): The scheduler.
#    action_name (str): The queue action name.
#    logfile (str): A template string that points to the logfile
#                   that should be used - should contain {pid}.
#    max_retries (int): The maximum number of retries.
#    tries (int): The number of retries so far.
#    message_element_name (str): None, or the plugin instance element name
#                                to be supplied to the Message() constructor.
#    message_element_key (tuple): None, or the element display key tuple
