#
# Unpickle the supplied 'pickled' job and call 'child_action' on it.
#
# This is expected to be run in a subprocess started from the main process, as
# such it will fixup any globals to be in the expected state.
#

#    pickled     (BytesIO): The pickled data, and job to execute.

# _not_main_process()
#
# A function to replace `utils._is_main_process` when we're running in a

# not work in this case.

# Note that we'll always not be the main process by definition.

# _pickle_child_job_data()
#
# Perform the special case pickling required to pickle a child job for
# unpickling in a child process.
#
# Note that this just enables the pickling of things that contain ChildJob-s,
# the thing to be pickled doesn't have to be a ChildJob.
#
# Note that we don't need an `unpickle_child_job_data`, as regular
# `pickle.load()` will do everything required.
#
# Args:
#    child_job_data (ChildJob): The job to be pickled.
#    projects  (List[Project]): The list of loaded projects, so we can get the
#                               relevant factories.
#
# Returns:
#    An `io.BytesIO`, with the pickled contents of the ChildJob and everything it
#    transitively refers to.
#
# Some types require special handling when pickling to send to another process.
# We register overrides for those special cases:
#
# o Very stateful objects: Some things carry much more state than they need for
#   pickling over to the child job process. This extra state brings
#   complication of supporting pickling of more types, and the performance
#   penalty of the actual pickling. Use private knowledge of these objects to
#   safely reduce the pickled state.
#
# o gRPC objects: These don't pickle, but they do have their own serialization
#   mechanism, which we use instead. To avoid modifying generated code, we
#   instead register overrides here.
#
# o Plugins: These cannot be unpickled unless the factory which created them
#   has been unpickled first, with the same identifier as before. See note
#   below. Some state in plugins is not necessary for child jobs, and comes
#   with a heavy cost; we also need to remove this before pickling.
