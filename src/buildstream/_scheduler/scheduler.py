# Scheduler()
#
# The scheduler operates on a list queues, each of which is meant to accomplish
# a specific task. Elements enter the first queue when Scheduler.run() is called
# and into the next queue when complete. Scheduler.run() returns when all of the
# elements have been traversed or when an error occurs.
#
# Using the scheduler is a matter of:
#   a.) Deriving the Queue class and implementing its abstract methods
#   b.) Instantiating a Scheduler with one or more queues
#   c.) Calling Scheduler.run(elements) with a list of elements
#   d.) Fetching results from your queues
#

#    state: The state that can be made available to the frontend
#    interrupt_callback: A callback to handle ^C
#    ticker_callback: A callback call once per second
