#

# elements have been traversed or when an error occurs.
#
# Using the scheduler is a matter of:
#   a.) Deriving the Queue class and implementing its abstract methods
#   b.) Instantiating a Scheduler with one or more queues
#   c.) Calling Scheduler.run(elements) with a list of elements
#   d.) Fetching results from your queues
