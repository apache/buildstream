Directory - Interfacing with files
==================================
The Directory class is given to plugins by way of the :class:`.Sandbox`
and in some other instances. This API allows plugins to interface with files
and directory hierarchies owned by BuildStream.


.. _directory_path:

Paths
-----
The path argument to directory functions depict a relative path. Path elements are
separated with the ``/`` character regardless of the platform. Both ``.`` and ``..`` entries
are permitted. Absolute paths are not permitted, as such it is illegal to specify a path
with a leading ``/`` character.

Directory objects represent a directory entry within the context of a *directory tree*,
and the directory returned by
:func:`Sandbox.get_virtual_directory() <buildstream.sandbox.Sandbox.get_virtual_directory>`
is the root of the sandbox's *directory tree*. Attempts to escape the root of a *directory tree*
using ``..`` entries will not result in an error, instead ``..`` entries which cross the
root boundary will be evaluated as the root directory. This behavior matches POSIX behavior
of filesystem root directories.
