Directory
=========

This is a virtual Directory class to isolate the rest of BuildStream
from the backing store implementation.  Sandboxes are allowed to read
from and write to the underlying storage, but all others must use this
Directory class to access files and directories in the sandbox.

See also: :ref:`sandboxing`.
