# except_elements():
#
# This function calculates the intersection of the `except_targets`
# element dependencies and the `targets` dependencies, and removes
# that intersection from the `elements` list, returning the result.
#
# Args:
#    targets: List of toplevel targetted elements
#    elements: The list to remove elements from
#    except_targets: List of toplevel except targets
#
# Returns:
#    The elements list with the intersected exceptions removed
#
# Important notes on the behavior
# ===============================
#
#   * Except elements can be completely outside of the scope
#     of targets.
#
#   * When the dependencies of except elements intersect with
#     dependencies of targets, those dependencies are removed
#     from the result.
#
#   * If a target is found within the intersection of excepted
#     elements, that target and it's dependencies are considered
#     exempt from the exception intersection.
#
# Example:
#
#           (t1)   (e1)
#           / \     /
#         (o) (o) ( )
#         /     \ / \
#       (o)     (x) ( )
#         \     /     \
#         (o) (x)     ( )
#           \ /
#           (x)
#           / \
#         (x) (t2)
#         / \ / \
#       (x) (x) (o)
#               / \
#             (o) (o)
#
# Here we have a mockup graph with 2 target elements (t1) and (t2),
# and one except element (e1) which lies outside of the graph.
#
#  - ( ) elements are ignored, they were never in the element list
#  - (o) elements will be included in the result
#  - (x) elements are removed from the graph
#
# Note how (t2) reintroduces portions of the graph which were otherwise
# tainted by being depended on indirectly by the (e1) except element.
