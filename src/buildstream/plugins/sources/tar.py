tar - stage files from tar archives
===================================

**Host dependencies:**

  * lzip (for .tar.lz files)

**Usage:**

.. code:: yaml

   # Specify the tar source kind
   kind: tar

   # Specify the tar url. Using an alias defined in your project
   # configuration is encouraged. 'bst source track' will update the
   # sha256sum in 'ref' to the downloaded file's sha256sum.
   url: upstream:foo.tar

   # Specify the ref. It's a sha256sum of the file you download.
   ref: 6c9f6f68a131ec6381da82f2bff978083ed7f4f7991d931bfa767b7965ebc94b

   # Specify a glob pattern to indicate the base directory to extract
   # from the tarball. The first matching directory will be used.
   #
   # Note that this is '*' by default since most standard release
   # tarballs contain a self named subdirectory at the root which
   # contains the files one normally wants to extract to build.
   #
   # To extract the root of the tarball directly, this can be set
   # to an empty string.
   base-dir: '*'

See :ref:`built-in functionality doumentation <core_source_builtins>` for
details on common configuration options for sources.
