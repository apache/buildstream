junction - Integrate subprojects
================================
This element is a link to another BuildStream project. It allows integration
of multiple projects into a single pipeline.

Overview
--------

.. code:: yaml

   kind: junction

   # Specify the BuildStream project source
   sources:
   - kind: git
     url: upstream:projectname.git
     track: master
     ref: d0b38561afb8122a3fc6bafc5a733ec502fcaed6

   # Specify the junction configuration
   config:

     # Override project options
     options:
       machine_arch: "%{machine_arch}"
       debug: True

     # Optionally look in a subpath of the source repository for the project
     path: projects/hello

     # Optionally specify another junction element to serve as a target for
     # this element. Target should be defined using the syntax
     # ``{junction-name}:{element-name}``.
     #
     # Note that this option cannot be used in conjunction with sources.
     target: sub-project.bst:sub-sub-project.bst

     # Optionally declare whether elements within the junction project
     # should interact with project remotes (default: False).
     cache-junction-elements: False

     # Optionally ignore junction remotes, this means that BuildStream
     # will not attempt to pull artifacts from the junction project's
     # remote(s) (default: False).
     ignore-junction-remotes: False

.. note::

   The configuration option to allow specifying junction targets is available
   since :ref:`format version 24 <project_format_version>` and the configuration
   options allowing for junction project elements to interact with parent remotes
   or to completely ignore junction project remotes are available since
   :ref:`format version 25 <project_format_version>`.

.. note::

   Junction elements may not specify any dependencies as they are simply
   links to other projects and are not in the dependency graph on their own.

With a junction element in place, local elements can depend on elements in
the other BuildStream project using the additional ``junction`` attribute in the
dependency dictionary:

.. code:: yaml

   depends:
   - junction: toolchain.bst
     filename: gcc.bst
     type: build

While junctions are elements, only a limited set of element operations is
supported. They can be tracked and fetched like other elements.
However, junction elements do not produce any artifacts, which means that
they cannot be built or staged. It also means that another element cannot
depend on a junction element itself.

.. note::

   Elements within the subproject are not tracked by default when running
   `bst source track`. You must specify `--cross-junctions` to the track
   command to explicitly do it.


Sources
-------
``bst show`` does not implicitly fetch junction sources if they haven't been
cached yet. However, they can be fetched explicitly:

.. code::

   bst source fetch junction.bst

Other commands such as ``bst build`` implicitly fetch junction sources.

Options
-------
.. code:: yaml

   options:
     machine_arch: "%{machine_arch}"
     debug: True

Junctions can configure options of the linked project. Options are never
implicitly inherited across junctions, however, variables can be used to
explicitly assign the same value to a subproject option.

.. _core_junction_nested:

Nested Junctions
----------------
Junctions can be nested. That is, subprojects are allowed to have junctions on
their own. Nested junctions in different subprojects may point to the same
project, however, in most use cases the same project should be loaded only once.
BuildStream uses the junction element name as key to determine which junctions
to merge. It is recommended that the name of a junction is set to the same as
the name of the linked project.

As the junctions may differ in source version and options, BuildStream cannot
simply use one junction and ignore the others. Due to this, BuildStream requires
the user to resolve possibly conflicting nested junctions by creating a junction
with the same name in the top-level project, which then takes precedence.

Targeting other junctions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When working with nested junctions, you can also create a junction element that
targets another junction element in the sub-project. This can be useful if you
need to ensure that both the top-level project and the sub-project are using
the same version of the sub-sub-project.

This can be done using the ``target`` configuration option. See below for an
example:

.. code:: yaml

   kind: junction

   config:
     target: subproject.bst:subsubproject.bst

In the above example, this junction element would be targeting the junction
element named ``subsubproject.bst`` in the subproject referred to by
``subproject.bst``.

Note that when targeting another junction, the names of the junction element
must not be the same as the name of the target.
