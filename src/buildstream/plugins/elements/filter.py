filter - Extract a subset of files from another element
=======================================================
Filter another element by producing an output that is a subset of
the parent element's output. Subsets are defined by the parent element's
:ref:`split rules <public_split_rules>`.

Overview
--------
A filter element must have exactly one *build* dependency, where said
dependency is the 'parent' element which we would like to filter.
Runtime dependencies may also be specified, which can be useful to propagate
forward from this filter element onto its reverse dependencies.
See :ref:`Dependencies <format_dependencies>` to see how we specify dependencies.

When workspaces are opened, closed or reset on a filter element, or this
element is tracked, the filter element will transparently pass on the command
to its parent element (the sole build-dependency).

Example
-------
Consider a simple import element, ``import.bst`` which imports the local files
'foo', 'bar' and 'baz' (each stored in ``files/``, relative to the project's root):

.. code:: yaml

   kind: import

   # Specify sources to import
   sources:
   - kind: local
     path: files

   # Specify public domain data, visible to other elements
   public:
     bst:
       split-rules:
         foo:
         - /foo
         bar:
         - /bar

.. note::

   We can make an element's metadata visible to all reverse dependencies by making use
   of the ``public:`` field. See the :ref:`public data documentation <format_public>`
   for more information.

In this example, ``import.bst`` will serve as the 'parent' of the filter element, thus
its output will be filtered. It is important to understand that the artifact of the
above element will contain the files: 'foo', 'bar' and 'baz'.

Now, to produce an element whose artifact contains the file 'foo', and exlusively 'foo',
we can define the following filter, ``filter-foo.bst``:

.. code:: yaml

   kind: filter

   # Declare the sole build-dependency of the filter element
   depends:
   - filename: import.bst
     type: build

   # Declare a list of domains to include in the filter's artifact
   config:
     include:
     - foo

.. note::

   We can also specify build-dependencies with a 'build-depends' field which has been
   available since :ref:`format version 14 <project_format_version>`. See the
   :ref:`Build-Depends documentation <format_build_depends>` for more detail.

It should be noted that an 'empty' ``include:`` list would, by default, include all
split-rules specified in the parent element, which, in this example, would be the
files 'foo' and 'bar' (the file 'baz' was not covered by any split rules).

Equally, we can use the ``exclude:`` statement to create the same artifact (which
only contains the file 'foo') by declaring the following element, ``exclude-bar.bst``:

.. code:: yaml

   kind: filter

   # Declare the sole build-dependency of the filter element
   depends:
   - filename: import.bst
     type: build

   # Declare a list of domains to exclude in the filter's artifact
   config:
     exclude:
     - bar

In addition to the ``include:`` and ``exclude:`` fields, there exists an ``include-orphans:``
(Boolean) field, which defaults to ``False``. This will determine whether to include files
which are not present in the 'split-rules'. For example, if we wanted to filter out all files
which are not included as split rules we can define the following element, ``filter-misc.bst``:

.. code:: yaml

   kind: filter

   # Declare the sole build-dependency of the filter element
   depends:
   - filename: import.bst
     type: build

   # Filter out all files which are not declared as split rules
   config:
     exclude:
     - foo
     - bar
     include-orphans: True

The artifact of ``filter-misc.bst`` will only contain the file 'baz'.

Below is more information regarding the the default configurations and possible options
of the filter element:
