stack - Symbolic Element for dependency grouping
================================================
Stack elements are simply a symbolic element used for representing
a logical group of elements.

All dependencies declared in stack elements must always be both
:ref:`build and runtime dependencies <format_dependencies_types>`.

**Example:**

.. code:: yaml

   kind: stack

   # Declare all of your dependencies in the `depends` list.
   depends:
   - libc.bst
   - coreutils.bst

.. note::

   Unlike other elements, whose cache keys are a unique identifier
   of the contents of the artifacts they produce, stack elements do
   not produce any artifact content. Instead, the cache key of an artifact
   is a unique identifier for the assembly of its own dependencies.


Using intermediate stacks
-------------------------
Using a stack element at intermediate levels of your build graph
allows you to abstract away some parts of your project into logical
subsystems which elements can more conveniently depend on as a whole.

In addition to the added convenience, it will allow you to more
easily change the implementation of a subsystem later on, without needing
to update many reverse dependencies to depend on new elements, or even
allow you to conditionally implement a subsystem with various implementations
depending on what :ref:`project options <project_options>` were specified at
build time.


Using toplevel stacks
---------------------
Stack elements can also be useful as toplevel targets in your build graph
to simply indicate all of the components which need to be built for a given
system to be complete, or for your integration pipeline to be successful.


Checking out and deploying toplevel stacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In case that your software is built remotely, it is possible to checkout
the built content of a stack on your own machine for the purposes of
inspection or further deployment.

To accomplish this, you will need to know the cache key of the stack element
which was built remotely, possibly by inspecting the remote build log or by
deriving it with an equally configured BuildStream project, and you will
need read access to the artifact cache server which the build was uploaded to,
this should be configured in your :ref:`user configuration file <config_artifact_caches>`.

You can then checkout the remotely built stack using the
:ref:`bst artifact checkout <invoking_artifact_checkout>` command and providing
it with the :ref:`artifact name <artifact_names>`:

**Example:**

.. code:: shell

   bst artifact checkout --deps build --pull --integrate \\
       --directory `pwd`/checkout \\
       project/stack/788da21e7c1b5818b7e7b60f7eb75841057ff7e45d362cc223336c606fe47f27

.. note::

   It is possible to checkout other elements in the same way, however stack
   elements are uniquely suited to this purpose, as they cannot have
   :ref:`runtime only dependencies <format_dependencies_types>`, and consequently
   their cache keys are always a unique representation of their collective
   dependencies.
