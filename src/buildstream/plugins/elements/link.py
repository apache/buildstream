"""
link - Link elements
================================
This element is a link to another element, allowing one to create
a symbolic element which will be resolved to another element.


Overview
--------
The only configuration allowed in a ``link`` element is the specified
target :ref:`element name <format_element_names>` of the link.

.. code:: yaml

   kind: link

   config:
     target: element.bst

The ``link`` element can be used to refer to elements in subprojects, and
can be used to symbolically link :mod:`junction <elements.junction>` elements
as well as other elements.
