"""
compose - Compose the output of multiple elements
=================================================
This element creates a selective composition of its dependencies.

This is normally used at near the end of a pipeline to prepare
something for later deployment.

Since this element's output includes its dependencies, it may only
depend on elements as `build` type dependencies.

The default configuration and possible options are as such:
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../src/buildstream/plugins/elements/compose.yaml
     :language: yaml
