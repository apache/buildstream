autotools - Autotools build element
===================================
This is a :mod:`BuildElement <buildstream.buildelement>` implementation for
using Autotools build scripts (also known as the `GNU Build System
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Build_System>`_).

You will often want to pass additional arguments to ``configure``. This should
be done on a per-element basis by setting the ``conf-local`` variable.  Here is
an example:

.. code:: yaml

   variables:
     conf-local: |
       --disable-foo --enable-bar

If you want to pass extra options to ``configure`` for every element in your
project, set the ``conf-global`` variable in your project.conf file. Here is
an example of that:

.. code:: yaml

   elements:
     autotools:
       variables:
         conf-global: |
           --disable-gtk-doc --disable-static

Here is the default configuration for the ``autotools`` element in full:

  .. literalinclude:: ../../../src/buildstream/plugins/elements/autotools.yaml
     :language: yaml

See :ref:`built-in functionality documentation <core_buildelement_builtins>` for
details on common configuration options for build elements.
