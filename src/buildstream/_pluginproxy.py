# PluginProxyError()
#
# The PluginProxyError is raised by PluginProxy objects when an illegal
# method call is called by a Plugin.
#
# This exception does not derive from BstError because it is not a user
# facing error but a Plugin author facing error; the result of a
# PluginProxyError being raised is that BuildStream treats it as an
# unhandled exception, and issues a BUG message with a helpful stacktrace
# which can be helpful for the Plugin author to fix their bugs.

# PluginProxy()
#
# Base class for proxies to Plugin instances.
#
# Proxies are handed off to Plugin implementations whenever they observe the data
# model, like when the Element observes it's dependencies, this allows the core to
# do some police work and raise errors when plugins attempt to perform illegal method
# calls.
#
# Refer to the Plugin class for the documentation for these APIs.
#
# In this file we simply raise a PluginProxyError() in the case that a Plugin tries to
# call an illegal API, or we forward the method call along to the underlying Plugin
# instance if the given method call is considered legal.
#
# Args:
#    owner (Plugin): The owning plugin, i.e. the plugin which this proxy was given to
#    plugin (Plugin): The proxied plugin, i.e. the plugin this proxy is attached to
#

    def __init__(self, owner: Plugin, plugin: Plugin):

        # which the proxy objects are handed off to.
