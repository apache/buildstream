#    Cache
#
cache:
  # Size of the artifact cache in bytes - BuildStream will attempt to keep the
  # artifact cache within this size.
  # If the value is suffixed with K, M, G or T, the specified memory size is
  # parsed as Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes, or Terabytes (with the base
  # 1024), respectively.
  # Alternatively, a percentage value may be specified, which is taken relative
  # to the isize of the file system containing the cache.
  quota: infinity

  # Whether to pull build trees when downloading element artifacts
  pull-buildtrees: False

  # Whether to cache build trees on artifact creation:
  #
  #  always  - Always cache artifact build tree content
  #  auto    - Only cache build trees when necessary, e.g., for failed builds
  #  never   - Never cache artifact build tree content. This is not recommended
  #            for normal users as this breaks core functionality such as
  #            debugging failed builds and may break additional functionality
  #            in future versions.
