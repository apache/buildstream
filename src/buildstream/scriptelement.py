ScriptElement - Abstract class for scripting elements
=====================================================
The ScriptElement class is a convenience class one can derive for
implementing elements that stage elements and run command-lines on them.

Any derived classes must write their own configure() implementation, using
the public APIs exposed in this class.

Derived classes must also chain up to the parent method in their preflight()
implementations.

           directories before subdirectories.

           in the predetermined deterministic staging order.
