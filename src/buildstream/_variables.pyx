# Throughout this code you will see variables named things like `expstr`.
# These hold data structures called "expansion strings" and are the parsed
# form of the strings which are the input to this subsystem.  Strings
# such as "Hello %{name}, how are you?" are parsed into the form:
# ["Hello ", "name", ", how are you?"]
# i.e. a list which consists of one or more strings.
# Strings in even indices of the list (0, 2, 4, etc) are constants which
# are copied into the output of the expansion algorithm.  Strings in the
# odd indices (1, 3, 5, etc) are the names of further expansions to make.
# In the example above, first "Hello " is copied, then "name" is expanded
# and so must be another named expansion string passed in to the constructor
# of the Variables class, and whatever is yielded from the expansion of "name"
# is added to the concatenation for the result.  Finally ", how are you?" is
# copied in and the whole lot concatenated for return.
#
# To see how strings are parsed, see `_parse_expstr()` after the class, and
# to see how expansion strings are expanded, see `_expand_expstr()` after that.
