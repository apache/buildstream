BuildElement - Abstract class for build elements
================================================
The BuildElement class is a convenience element one can derive from for
implementing the most common case of element.


.. _core_buildelement_builtins:

Built-in functionality
----------------------
The BuildElement base class provides built in functionality that could be
overridden by the individual plugins.

This section will give a brief summary of how some of the common features work,
some of them or the variables they use will be further detailed in the following
sections.


The `strip-binaries` variable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The `strip-binaries` variable is by default **empty**. You need to use the
appropiate commands depending of the system you are building.
If you are targetting Linux, ones known to work are the ones used by the
`freedesktop-sdk <https://freedesktop-sdk.io/>`_, you can take a look to them in their
`project.conf <https://gitlab.com/freedesktop-sdk/freedesktop-sdk/blob/freedesktop-sdk-18.08.21/project.conf#L74>`_


Location for staging dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The BuildElement supports the "location" :term:`dependency configuration <Dependency configuration>`,
which means you can use this configuration for any BuildElement class.

The "location" configuration defines where the dependency will be staged in the
build sandbox.

**Example:**

Here is an example of how one might stage some dependencies into
an alternative location while staging some elements in the sandbox root.

.. code:: yaml

   # Stage these build dependencies in /opt
   #
   build-depends:
   - baseproject.bst:opt-dependencies.bst
     config:
       location: /opt

   # Stage these tools in "/" and require them as
   # runtime dependencies.
   depends:
   - baseproject.bst:base-tools.bst

.. note::

    The order of dependencies specified is not significant.

    The staging locations will be sorted so that elements are staged in parent
    directories before subdirectories.


`digest-environment` for dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The BuildElement supports the ``digest-environment`` :term:`dependency configuration <Dependency configuration>`,
which sets the specified environment variable in the build sandbox to the CAS digest
corresponding to a directory that contains all dependencies that are configured
with the same ``digest-environment``.

This is useful for REAPI clients in the sandbox such as `recc <https://buildgrid.gitlab.io/recc>`_,
see ``remote-apis-socket`` in the :ref:`sandbox configuration <format_sandbox>`.

**Example:**

Here is an example of how to set the environment variable `GCC_DIGEST` to the
CAS digest of a directory that contains ``gcc.bst`` and its runtime dependencies.
The ``libpony.bst`` dependency will not be included in that CAS directory.

.. code:: yaml

   build-depends:
   - baseproject.bst:gcc.bst
     config:
       digest-environment: GCC_DIGEST
   - libpony.bst


Location for running commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``command-subdir`` variable sets where commands will be executed,
and the directory will be created automatically if it does not exist.

The ``command-subdir`` is a relative path from ``%{build-root}``, and
cannot be a parent or adjacent directory, it must expand to a subdirectory
of ``${build-root}``.


Location for configuring the project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``conf-root`` is the location that specific build elements can use to look for build configuration files.
This is used by elements such as `autotools <https://apache.github.io/buildstream-plugins/elements/autotools.html>`_,
`cmake <https://apache.github.io/buildstream-plugins/elements/cmake.html>`_,
`meson <https://apache.github.io/buildstream-plugins/elements/meson.html>`_,
`setuptools <https://apache.github.io/buildstream-plugins/elements/setuptools.html>`_ and
`pip <https://apache.github.io/buildstream-plugins/elements/pip.html>`_.

The default value of ``conf-root`` is defined by default as ``.``. This means that if
the ``conf-root`` is not explicitly set to another directory, the configuration
files are expected to be found in ``command-subdir``.


Separating source and build directories
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
A typical example of using ``conf-root`` is when performing
`autotools <https://apache.github.io/buildstream-plugins/elements/autotools.html>`_ builds
where your source directory is separate from your build directory.

This can be achieved in build elements which use ``conf-root`` as follows:

.. code:: yaml

   variables:
     # Specify that build configuration scripts are found in %{build-root}
     conf-root: "%{build-root}"

     # The build will run in the `_build` subdirectory
     command-subdir: _build


Install Location
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Build elements must install the build output to the directory defined by ``install-root``.

You need not set or change the ``install-root`` variable as it will be defined
automatically on your behalf, and it is used to collect build output when creating
the resulting artifacts.

It is important to know about ``install-root`` in order to write your own
custom install instructions, for example the
`cmake <https://apache.github.io/buildstream-plugins/elements/cmake.html>`_
element will use it to specify the ``DESTDIR``.


Abstract method implementations
-------------------------------


Element.configure_sandbox()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In :func:`Element.configure_sandbox() <buildstream.element.Element.configure_sandbox>`,
the BuildElement will ensure that the sandbox locations described by the ``%{build-root}``
and ``%{install-root}`` variables are marked and will be mounted read-write for the
:func:`assemble phase<buildstream.element.Element.configure_sandbox>`.

The working directory for the sandbox will be configured to be the ``%{build-root}``,
unless the ``%{command-subdir}`` variable is specified for the element in question,
in which case the working directory will be configured as ``%{build-root}/%{command-subdir}``.


Element.stage()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In :func:`Element.stage() <buildstream.element.Element.stage>`, the BuildElement
will do the following operations:

* Stage all of the build dependencies into the sandbox root.

* Run the integration commands for all staged dependencies using
  :func:`Element.integrate() <buildstream.element.Element.integrate>`

* Stage any Source on the given element to the ``%{build-root}`` location
  inside the sandbox, using
  :func:`Element.stage_sources() <buildstream.element.Element.integrate>`


Element.assemble()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In :func:`Element.assemble() <buildstream.element.Element.assemble>`, the
BuildElement will proceed to run sandboxed commands which are expected to be
found in the element configuration.

Commands are run in the following order:

* ``configure-commands``: Commands to configure the build scripts
* ``build-commands``: Commands to build the element
* ``install-commands``: Commands to install the results into ``%{install-root}``
* ``strip-commands``: Commands to strip debugging symbols installed binaries

The result of the build is expected to end up in ``%{install-root}``, and
as such; Element.assemble() method will return the ``%{install-root}`` for
artifact collection purposes.

.. note::

   In the case that the element is currently workspaced, the ``configure-commands``
   will only be run in subsequent builds until they succeed at least once, unless
   :ref:`bst workspace reset --soft <invoking_workspace_reset>` is called on the
   workspace to explicitly avoid an incremental build.
