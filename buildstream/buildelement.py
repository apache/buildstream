"""The BuildElement class is a convenience element one can derive from for
implementing the most common case of element.


Description of assemble activities
----------------------------------
This element will perform the following steps to assemble an element:

Stage dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The dependencies in the :func:`Scope.BUILD <buildstream.element.Scope.BUILD>`
scope will be staged at the root of the sandbox

Integrate dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The integration commands taken from the ``bst`` public domain of each dependency
will be run in the sandbox to create and update caches. Typically ``ldconfig``
among other things is run in this step.

Stage sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
:mod:`Sources <buildstream.source>` are now staged according to their configuration
into the ``%{build-root}`` directory (normally ``/buildstream/build``) inside the sandbox.

Run commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Commands are now run in the sandbox.

Commands are taken from the element configuration specified by the given
:mod:`BuildElement <buildstream.buildelement>` subclass, which can in turn be
overridden by the user in element declarations (``.bst`` files).

Commands are run in the following order:

* ``configure-commands``: Commands to configure how the element will build
* ``build-commands``: Commands to build the element
* ``install-commands``: Commands to install the results into ``%{install-root}``
* ``strip-commands``: Commands to strip debugging symbols installed binaries

In addition to the above command domains, each command list is checked
for a ``pre-`` and ``post-`` command domain. So for instance, an element
declaration can append or prepend commands without overriding the existing
defaults provided by the element type

**Example**

.. code:: yaml

  config:
    pre-configure-commands:
    - echo "Do something before default configure-commands"

**Working Directory**

Note that by default the working directory is where the sources are staged in
``%{build-root}``, but this can be overridden to build inside of a subdirectory
of the build directory using the ``command-subdir`` variable in an element
declaration. e.g.:

.. code:: yaml

  variables:
    command-subdir: src

The above fragment will cause all commands to be run in the ``src/`` subdirectory
of the staged sources.


Result collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Finally, the resulting build *artifact* is collected from the the ``%{install-root}``
directory (which is normally configured as ``/buildstream/install``) inside the sandbox.

All build elements must install into the ``%{install-root}`` using whatever
semantic the given build system provides to do this. E.g. for standard autotools
packages we simply do ``make DESTDIR=%{install-root} install``.
