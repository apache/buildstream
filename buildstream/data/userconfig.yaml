#    Cache
#
cache:
  # Size of the artifact cache in bytes - BuildStream will attempt to keep the
  # artifact cache within this size.
  # If the value is suffixed with K, M, G or T, the specified memory size is
  # parsed as Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes, or Terabytes (with the base
  # 1024), respectively.
  # Alternatively, a percentage value may be specified, which is taken relative
  # to the isize of the file system containing the cache.
